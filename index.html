        <div class="heading">What is the Carbon Cycle?</div>
        <div class="paragraph">
            The carbon cycle is a cycle of carbon (in the form of CO2) being added or taken from the atmosphere balancing it out
            The processes are usually done through processes, such as: combustion, AI generation etc.. The cycle is the
            balance of CO<sub>2</sub> getting removed and added. The problem is the imbalance of carbon in the
            atmosphere. Too much or a lack of CO<sub>2</sub> will kill off most of the aerobic life on earth.
           The problem right now is that we are producing too much CO<sub>2</sub>. This is through ways such as combustion,
           burning and exhaling. On the contrary the way that CO<sub>2</sub> is used is mainly in photosynthesis for plants
            but due to deforestation that isn't removing enough carbon from the atmosphere (kmansfield).

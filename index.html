    <div class="heading">What is the Carbon Cycle?</div><br>
    <div class="paragraph">
        The carbon cycle is a cycle of carbon (in the form of CO2) being added to or taken from the atmosphere,
        balancing it out
        The processes are usually done through processes, such as: combustion, AI generatio,n etc.. The cycle is the
        balance of CO<sub>2</sub> getting removed and added. The problem is the imbalance of carbon in the
        atmosphere. Too much or a lack of CO<sub>2</sub> will kill off most of the aerobic life on earth.
        The problem right now is that we are producing too much CO<sub>2</sub>. This is through ways such as combustion,
        burning, and exhaling. On the contrary, the way that CO<sub>2</sub> is used is mainly in photosynthesis for
        plants
        but due to deforestation, it isn't removing enough carbon from the atmosphere. (kmansfield).

    <div class="paragraph">
        We are the biggest problem when it comes to balancing the atmosphere is us. We create an unbalance of
        CO<sub>2</sub>
        in unnatural ways such as combustion, burning (for example, fossil fuels), Generative AI, and many more. We also
        lower
        CO<sub>2</sub> intake by chopping trees and trashing in the ocean.

    <div class="heading">How does AI change the Carbon Cycle</div>
    <div class="paragraph">
        Now diving specfically in AI a modern cause of carbon cycle disruption. Massive amounts of energy is used for AI
        every day.
        It's not even limited to electricity LLM's use ~50 million gallons according to Barnett. This is even worse for
        LLM's for example chatGPT has over 1 million GPUs (Zewe).

    <div class="paragraph">
        What are some ways to prevent AI? Some ways incude spreading awareness and donating. On a global scale more AI
        regulation and laws will help in controlling AI. Regulation can also help with preventing illegal use casses, 
        enviroment destruction (incuding the imbalance of the carbon cycle).
